\chapter{Conclusion}
This work will bridge an important gap between the mechanisms for metadata management and the metadata migration heuristics. This proposal shows how the metadata management problem is analogous to many other distributed system problems. We outline the motivation for using CephFS to solve the metadata management and reflect on some of its unique implementation details. We discuss the metrics that describe the local and global system state and select which are the most important for balancing load. Finally, we outline the heuristics we will (in)validate along the way, including: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item aggressive vs. hesitant migrations
	\item centralized vs. decentralized knowledge
	\item accuracy vs. speed calculation
	\item learning vs. forgetting rate
	\item large vs. small migration units
\end{itemize}
