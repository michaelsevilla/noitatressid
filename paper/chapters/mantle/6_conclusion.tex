\section{Conclusion}
The flexibility of dynamic subtree partitioning introduces significant complexity and many of the challenges that the original balancer tries to address are general, distributed systems problems. In this paper, we present Mantle, a programmable metadata balancer for CephFS that decouples policies from the mechanisms for migration by exposing a general ``balancing" API. We explore the locality vs. distribution space and make important conclusions about the performance and stability implications of migrating load. The key takeaway from using Mantle is that distributing metadata can negatively both performance and stability. With Mantle, we are able to compare the strategies for metadata distribution instead of the underlying systems. With this general framework, broad distributed systems concepts can be explored in depth to gain insights into the true bottlenecks that we face with modern workloads.
